# Ship Detection in SAR images using CenterNet
Convolutional neural network model based on the architecture of the DLAnet-34 and ResNet-34 for ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR). For this project I have used a pretrained model on ImageNet dataset, and fine-tuned it for the task of ship detection from microwave image data.
