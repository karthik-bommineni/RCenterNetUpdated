# Ship Detection in SAR images using CenterNet
Convolutional neural network model based on the architecture of the Faster-RCNN for wildfire smoke detection. For this project we used a pretrained model on ImageNet dataset, from detectron2's Model Zoo, and fine-tuned it for the task of wildfire smoke detection from optical image data.
